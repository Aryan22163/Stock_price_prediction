# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting using Facebook Prophet (Time Series Analysis)

This project focuses on **time series forecasting** of stock prices using **Facebook Prophet**, a robust and interpretable model developed by Meta. The aim is to predict future stock closing prices based on historical data without building traditional machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical stock prices with these key features:
- `Date`
- `Open`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Close`
- `Volume`

> Data was reformatted for Prophet as:
> - `ds` → Date  
> - `y` → Closing Price
